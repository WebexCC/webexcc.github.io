## Introduction

In this lab you will learn about configuring Webex Contact centre to manage outbound voice campaigns using the LCM (List and Campaign Manager) application.

## Lab Objective

1. Configure Webex Contact Centre and LCM (List and Campaign Manager) application
2. Verify that the Agents can accept outbound campaign calls from the Webex CC Agent Desktop

## Lab Pre-requisites

- In this lab tenant, the tenant provisioning and integration is already completed. If you are using a different tenant, you can configure and use outbound campaigns only if your enterprise has purchased the Acqueon SKU and provisioning, integration is completed.
- You should also be able to login to agent desktop with your respective team created in previous labs
- This step should have been completed as part of previous lab sections. If not already done, please create a team and add your agent to this new team
- Acqueon tenant version should be `v4.2.1.2310 and above` ( instructions in this guide are based on `v4.2.1.2401`)

## Lab Section

# Lab 9.1 Verify Tenant Provisioning

- Login to Control Hub, navigate to Contact Center Settings > Addons and ensure `Campaign Management` option is enabled

![Outbound](/assets/images/Acqueon/AE_9.1.1.gif)

- Navigate to `Integrations` option and ensure a custom connector with the name `CampaignManagerCredential` is created

![Outbound](/assets/images/Acqueon/AE_9.1.2.gif)

> Note: The steps mentioned above are integral to the Acqueon provisioning and integration process and should have been completed as part of your initial setup. This current step serves merely as a verification to ensure everything is in place before you begin with the lab. This has already been completed for the lab tenant. If you are using a different tenant and discover that any of the necessary steps have not been completed on your tenant, please consult the Webex Contact Center Ordering Guide available at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/partners/tools/collaboration-ordering-guides.html. Here, you can find the relevant SKUs and instructions on how to place your order.

### Step 10: Accept the Campaign Contact from Agent Desktop

- Login to desktop with agent credentials and select the appropriate team that was selected during the outdial queue creation.
- Change agent status to `Available`

> The below example/demo covers a progressive 1:N dialer with Call Progress Analysis (CPA).

- Once an agent is available, the system will place `N` customer calls (This value is configured in Step 7 under `Dial Rate` configuration)

- For calls which result in live voice, the system will connect the agents

- If customer call is abandoned or goes to voicemail, our system will invoke the flow to determine how to handle the scenario (Through Configurations done in `Step4`)

![Outbound](/assets/images/Acqueon/AE_9.3.24.gif)

- In the `Progressive & Predictive Campaign Realtime Report` we can verify that both the numbers in the contact list were dialed once an agent was available
